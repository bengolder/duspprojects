// have a node class that can be used to convert all the things

// I also need a way to make links
//
// for links I need a source and target

// I can assign an x and y value to a node
// My assumption is that d3 adds x and y attributes if they don't exist on the
// node. So I can easily give starting x and y, or edit the x and y
//
//
// So for each node I maybe need an x or y, but I also need a vector for going
// to the next step  and when things move in ways that are not based on the
// force diagram, they will need to interpolate along that vector.
